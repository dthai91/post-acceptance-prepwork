# Week 1: Basic Object-Oriented Programming

This week's coursework will teach you the basic building blocks of Ruby.
By the end of the week, you should know how to manipulate Ruby's basic
data types, and understand the fundamentals of working with classes. You
should also know how to keep your code clean and readable.

Before you begin, make sure you have your [environment][environment]
set up appropriately. The [Cloud9][c9] reading has instructions for
downloading the exercises through Github.

Also review the [daily workflow][workflow]. Complete the readings, work
through the exercises, refactor your code, and make sure you understand
the provided solutions before you proceed to the next day's work.

[c9]: ./../cloud9
[environment]: ./../w0/environment-setup.md
